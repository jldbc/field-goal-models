**Probabilistic modeling of NFL field goals**

Uses logistic regression, multiple linear regression, neural networks, and random forests to form probability estimates on field goals. Using these estimates, an unbiased measurement of kicker ability can be formed by measuring points added above expectation per attempt over individual seasons or entire careers. Presented at Boston College Big Data Research Day as "Machine Learning and the NFL Field Goal."
